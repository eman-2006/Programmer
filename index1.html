					<h2>Agent 47 is a killing machine programmed to live up to his reputation of showing no remorse and being devoid of any human emotion carrying out his h
					its, e
					specially in the reimagined Hitman trilogy. However, this moment from Absolution shows a more tender side to Agent 47 rarely seen, even though it doesn
					't have 
					the most profound emotional effect.

						In 2012's Absolution, he must protect Victoria, a young girl that was also a genetically engineered asset like him bein
						g hunted after. 47 carries a sickly Victoria in his arms across the hospital wards of the Rosewood Orphanage as orchestral music is playing.
							He empathizes with her situation, even softly reassuring her that "No one will harm you ever again.</h2>
